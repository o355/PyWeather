# PyWeather Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
Last updated: October 21, 2017

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Helping to clear up confusion between community members
* Giving other community members "tips", and other helpful advice.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, even with explicit permission.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Managing the project as a contributor (e.g. Contacting companies about PyWeather for us, etc.)

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers are also responsible for managing PyWeather. Examples of this include contacting companies about PyWeather, managing the newsletter, and maintaining PyWeather as a whole.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at pyweather <at> owenthe <dot> ninja. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
  
If project maintainers find instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, project maintainers will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

If an instance of unacceptable behavior was deemed to be not in acceptance of the code of conduct, the responsible user will face a punishment that will deny them the right to contribute to PyWeather for a certain period of time, or permanently. The first warning a user receives will be a warning, with no punishments depending on the severity of the punishment.

## Contacting

If contributors have any questions in regards to this code of conduct, or PyWeather in general, they may contact the project maintainer team at pyweather <at> owenthe <dot> ninja.
