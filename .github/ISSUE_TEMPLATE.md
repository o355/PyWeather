Hi! Thanks for your interest in contributing to PyWeather, by reporting an issue.

It's simply impossible for me to catch every bug in PyWeather, so you can help! Before you report an issue, run down this to-do list.
* Make sure PyWeather is up-to-date. I do manage to catch a fair amount of bugs in PyWeather releases.
* Make sure your issue isn't on the list of known issues. The page is available in the wiki, [here](https://github.com/o355/PyWeather/wiki/Known-Issues).
* Make sure you've properly set up PyWeather, so no import errors (unless I made a typo), etc. If you're unsure, report the issue anyways. 
* If your issue can be replicated, turn on tracebacks in the config file for the script it occurs in. If your issue occurs in the setup script, make setup_tracebacks true, and so on and so forth.

Done with the list? Here's what you'll need for a report.
* The full traceback provided by the Python interpreter.
* System information (OS version, Python version)
* A description detailing the issue

You can go the extra mile by adding this stuff to your report.
* Potential solutions (if you know how to code Python, a PR is highly appreciated!)
* Testing where the issue occurs (some bugs may be limited to certain OSes)
* Anything else you think you should add to your report

If you'd like to keep this template in your report, that's completely fine. Otherwise, report the issue!
