**THE GIT UPDATER IS STILL BROKEN, AND IS REMOVED IN 0.6.3 BETA. A NEW UPDATER WILL BE COMING IN THE NEXT VERSION.**

**PyWeather 0.6.3 beta requires a new library, halo. The configupdate script should automatically install this, but you
can (or might need to) install it yourself. The configupdate script will still update your config, even if halo can't be installed.**

**NEW FEATURES/REMOVALS:**
* Adds a nearby location feature to hurricane data (300km out)
* Will push the API key validation code up further thanks to new features.
* Adding a much nicer progress indicator.
* Adds the ability to prefetch yesterday's weather at boot, and a caching system. (thanks to @ModoUnreal for partially coding this in!)
* Adds the ability to view your current location through a GeoIP service
* Adds the ability to view data through a PWS at boot.
* Adds the ability to have up to 5 favorite locations.
* Adds the ability to manually define a Google Maps API key
* Much better error catching for the config file (thanks to @TheLetterAndrew for coding this in!)
* Adds the ability to view the chance of precipitation on the forecast page.
* Adding the ability to show cache timings.
* The ability to see pressure and visibility data has been added to historical hourly & yesterday hourly information.
* Minor UI changes.

**BUG FIXES:**
* Fixed multiple major bugs regarding invalid historical summary data & historical hourly data
* Fixed multiple major bugs regarding invalid yesterday summary data & yesterday hourly data
* Fixed a bug where if you didn't have API key validation on, PyWeather validated your API key, and vice versa.
* Fixed potential bugs where PyWeather wouldn't properly display precip information for forecast data - The algorithm was reworked.
* Fixed a bug where if you manually flagged all data types to refresh, hurricane data wouldn't be refreshed.
* Fixed a minor bug where if the summary section couldn't be added in the setup file, the print statement indicated that the cache section wasn't added.
* Fixed a bug where PyWeather didn't catch bad visibility, UV index, and humidity data for current weather
* Fixed a bug where the visibility in km on the yesterday's summary screen read as "kph".
* Fixed a minor bug where on yesterday's weather hourly data, the degree symbol was placed too far right by 1 character.
* Fixed a potential bug where missing data on yesterday's weather would cause a crash.
* Fixed a potential bug where if almanac data is prefetched, it wouldn't display when viewing it in detail, and PyWeather would crash.
* Fixed a minor bug where on the historical weather summary, total precipitation data in mm had a "mb" label.
* Fixed a minor bug where historical hourly data wouldn't break when the current iterations equaled the total iterations.
* Fixed a minor bug where PyWeather wouldn't catch bad humidity data for current conditions.
* Fixed a bug where configsetup script set the default geocoder scheme to https, which caused issues on platforms that don't support the geocoder running in the HTTPS scheme.

**OTHER CHANGES:**
* The Git Updater has been completely removed, as it's been unreliable. A universal updater will be introduced later in time.
* The configupdate file will now properly catch a bad section error (not a plain except)

**KNOWN ISSUES:**
* Tide data may not be fully available for some cities. I'm working on a fix for 0.6.4 beta.
* Attempting to exit out of historical weather is bugged. I'm also working on a fix for 0.6.4 beta.
* Hurricanes in hurricane data will show up twice. I've already contacted Wunderground about the issue, but they haven't responded back. A fix is coming in 0.6.4 beta.
* A custom geocoder key won't work without an https-enabled scheme. There is a temporary fix in 0.6.3 beta, but a more comprehensive fix will be coming in 0.6.4 beta.
* The configsetup script will default to an http scheme regardless of if your OS is https compatible or not. A more comprehensive fix will be coming in 0.6.4 beta.
